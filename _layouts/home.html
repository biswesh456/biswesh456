				I am currently a fifth-year Integrated Master of Technology (Bachelors + Masters) student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT Bangalore, India</a>.

				I have a keen interest on working in the field of Machine Reasoning. I want to incorporate prior knowledge from structural information(like Knowledge Graphs) to make the models robust in various domains of Natural Language Processing(NLP). The emerging field of Neuro-Symbolic AI has recently captured my attention. Besides this, I have experience working on various NLP fields especially in Task Oriented Dialog Systems, Machine Translations, Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies.

    Currently, I am working on a project on incorporating Ontological Information into embeddings for faster reasoning as part of my Masterâ€™s thesis under <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/g-srinivasaraghavan">Prof. G. Srinivasaraghavan</a> in collaboration with IBM Research AI(<a href="http://sumitbhatia.net/">Sumit Bhatia</a>) and <a href="https://kracr.github.io/">Knowledgable Computing and Reasoning Lab</a>.
