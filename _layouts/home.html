				I am a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">Inria, Paris</a> working with the <a href="http://articulab.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/"> Articulab</a> group under <a href="http://www.justinecassell.com/">Prof. Justine Cassell</a>. I am currently working on Socially Aware Embodied Conversational Agents. I have done Integrated Master of Technology (B.Tech + M.Tech) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT Bangalore, India</a>.

      <p>
				I have a keen interest on working in the field of Conversational AI and Dialog Systems. I want to incorporate prior knowledge from structural information(like Knowledge Graphs) into our dialog models to make them better at common sense reasoning. I am also interested in looking at the non-verbal behaviours during the conversations and use them to solve problems like grounding, intersubjectivity and progression in dialog systems. Besides this, I have experience working on Machine Translations, Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies.

    For my Master's thesis, I worked on a project on incorporating Ontological Information into embeddings for faster reasoning under <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/g-srinivasaraghavan">Prof. G. Srinivasaraghavan</a> in collaboration with IBM Research AI(<a href="http://sumitbhatia.net/">Sumit Bhatia</a>) and <a href="https://kracr.github.io/">Knowledgable Computing and Reasoning Lab</a>.
